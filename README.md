# JDC Documentation

This repository makes the documentation for the 
JCOIN data commons using mkdocs and related plugins.

The `archive` folder may contain useful tidbits (albeit incomplete).  

# Set up

set up virtual env with the requirements.txt if pip or environments.yml if conda

run `mkdocs serve` for local dev
run `mkdocs gh-deploy` to deploy to production

# install pdf creation plugin
There are a few packages available such as mkdocs-with-pdf
On Windows, both give the error:
```
```cannot load library 'gobject-2.0-0': error 0x7e.  Additionally, ctypes.util.find_library() did not manage to locate a library called 'gobject-2.0-0'```

```

## Notes

Now using frictionless so submission procedures will center around using this.
