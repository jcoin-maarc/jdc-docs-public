About ## The Opioid Environment Policy Scan (OEPS) is a free, open-source data warehouse providing access to data at multiple spatial scales to help characterize the multi-dimensional risk environment impacting opioid use in justice populations across the United States. The OEPS developed for the Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (JCOIN) by the team at the Healthy Regions and Policies Lab , Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago Data is also available to the JCOIN Network through the JCOIN Data Commons . We developed the OEPS as a free, open-source platform to aggregate and share publicly-available data at the Census tract, zip code, county, and state levels. Geographic boundary shapefiles are provided for ease of merging datasets (csv files) for exploration, spatial analysis, or visualization. Download the entire data repository, or you can filter and download by theme or spatial scale with the OEPS Explorer . All datasets are accompanied by metadata docs, detailing their source data, year, and more. Learn more about our methods and approaches, including the risk environment framework, in Methodology .

Estimate; Per capita income in the past 12 months (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars) . Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Note: Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. The following variables were included from DP03 : * Percent estimate; Unemployment Rate . The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed individuals as a percentage of the civilian labor force. The following variables were included from S1701 : * Percent Estimate; Percent below poverty level . The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold. Note: Poverty status was determined for all people except institutionalized people, people in military group quarters, people in college dormitories, and unrelated individuals under 15 years old. These groups were excluded from the numerator and denominator when calculating poverty rates. For more on variable definitions, see ACS 2018 Subject Definitions .

HepVu is a Powered by AIDSVu project presented by the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in partnership with Gilead Sciences, Inc. Definitions: ## Hepatitis C Prevalence : The data reflect persons with a positive or indeterminate anti-Hepatitis C virus (HCV) test and positive HCV RNA test. Hepatitis C Mortality : The data reflect deaths among persons with acute viral hepatitis C or chronic viral hepatitis C as an underlying cause of death. The map title \u201cDeaths related to Hepatitis C\u201d has been used to encompass deaths of persons diagnosed with acute or chronic Hepatitis C. Description of Data Source Tables: ## Read the complete descriptions of data source tables at HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C Prevalence Estimates : State-level Hepatitis C prevalence estimates (2013-2016 average) from HepVu were published by the Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP) researchers. These estimates were calculated using four data sources \u2013 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999-2016), National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (1999-2016), American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) (2012-2016), and U.S. Census intercensal data (1999-2016). The Hepatitis C prevalence analyses were restricted to people aged 18 years or older, living within the 50 states and D.C. Rates are expressed as the number of estimated cases per 100,000 people in the population, rounded to the nearest 10 persons. It is an expression of the relative concentration of people with current Hepatitis C infection in an area (state). Estimated cases are rounded to the nearest hundred persons. For a complete description, see HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C State Mortality Data The state-level Hepatitis C mortality data presented on HepVu (single-year data from 2005-2017) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER Online Database System and compiled by researchers at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. The CDC WONDER data are collected using information from death certificates of all U.S. residents within the 50 states and D.C. Deaths of residents of other U.S. territories and fetal deaths are not included. Demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information for each individual is recorded. Any records that included the ICD-10 code for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) or chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as the underlying or multiple cause of death were used to identify deaths related to hepatitis C. For a complete description, see HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C County Mortality Data The county-level hepatitis C mortality data presented on HepVu (single-year data from 2000-2017) were published by Eric Hall, et. al., in a paper titled \u201cCounty-Level Variation in Hepatitis C Virus Mortality and Trends in the United States, 2005-2017.\u201d These estimates were calculated using data from the National Center for Health Statistics Detailed Multiple Cause of Death (1999-2017) using deaths that listed ICD-10 codes for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) and chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as a multiple cause of death. For a complete description, see HepVu's Data Methods .

States totals may not sum to national total due to rounding. Traditional medicaid spending refers to medicaid spending that does not include spending on adults enrolled in the ACA expansion group. Expansion group spending refers to spending for adults who have enrolled in Medicaid through the ACA's expansion of the program. N/A: Not applicable. State did not expand Medicaid as of September 2018.","title":"Comments/Notes:"},{"location":"oeps/MedMarijLaw/","text":"Meta Data Name : Medical Marijuana Policies Last Modified : March 2, 2021 Author : Qinyun Lin Data Location: ## PS09 - at the state level.

Electronic PDMP starting date ElcPDMPdt Date state began operating an electronic PDMP system. Data Limitations: ## There currently does not exist a standard definition about what counts as Electronic PDMP. Comments/Notes: ## According to Horowitz et al (2018), the variable AnyPDMPHdt in this dataset records month and year of when any type of PDMP was enacted (including paper-based systems) according to legislation; the variable OpPDMPdt records month and year of when that PDMP data became accessible to any user (e.g., physician, pharmacist, or member of law enforcement) authorized by state law to receive it. Some caveats regarding operational PDMP: States that required prescribers or dispensers to keep records of prescriptions, but not send them to a central repository, were not considered to have a PDMP. If the statute stated a specific date when the PDMP was required to exist, this date was included, not the effective date of the statute. If the authorization of the PDMP was contingent upon receiving sufficient funding, the date of when funding was secured was used. Regarding \u201cmust access\u201d provisions, various data sources use the term \u201cmandatory use\u201d to mean different things. Mandatory use (which differs from mandatory registration) may simply mean that prescribers must have an account on the system; that they must input their patient\u2019s information in the system, or that they must check the system before prescribing an opioid under different circumstances (more on this policy here ). These are ultimately different levels of specificity of the law, and in the spirit of Horowitz et al., 2018, which encourages greater specificity in how these laws are defined, it is appropriate to use the term \u201cphysician must access\u201d only when prescribers are mandated to access the database (regardless of the circumstance, which could differ if it is new patient, existing patient, and so on). The database that best captures this definition is constructed by PDAPS and shows that no state adopted a \u201cprescriber must access\u201d law until 2012. Other papers using data sets showing earlier dates typically have weaker definitions of this policy, such as (a) including state laws that require prescribers to register in the system or use it together \u2013 as was done by Patrick et al., 2016 (Health Affairs paper), or (b) indicating that physicians actually have access to the data in the system, but not requiring that they access the data before prescribing \u2013 which was done in Horowitz et al., 2018 (NBER working paper). Neither of these are a pure \u201cmust access\u201d requirement and could lead to earlier implementation dates than what actually were required for true \u201cmust access\u201d provisions. For example, a lot of papers count Nevada\u2019s 2007 must-access PDMP. PDAPS does not count Nevada because PDAPS only counts policies as must-access if the policy required physicians to access/use the data system based on objective criteria. Nevada\u2019s 2007 law basically said physicians must access \u201cif they suspect abuse\u201d but did not define what \u201csuspected abuse\u201d looked like. In 2015, Nevada put criteria on the conditions requiring PDMP use. As such, the Must Access PDMP captures the need for prescribers to check before prescribing to a patient. Note that this is NOT dispensers to access before dispensing. Also, must-access is interpreted to apply to ANY subset of patients.","title":"Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMP)"},{"location":"oeps/PDMP_2017/#data-location","text":"PS03 - at the state level.

Nevada\u2019s 2007 law basically said physicians must access \u201cif they suspect abuse\u201d but did not define what \u201csuspected abuse\u201d looked like. In 2015, Nevada put criteria on the conditions requiring PDMP use. As such, the Must Access PDMP captures the need for prescribers to check before prescribing to a patient. Note that this is NOT dispensers to access before dispensing. Also, must-access is interpreted to apply to ANY subset of patients.","title":"Comments/Notes:"},{"location":"oeps/Prison%20variables_2016/","text":"Meta Data Name : Prison Incarceration Rates Last Modified : August 26th, 2020 Author : Qinyun Lin Data Location: ## PS01 - Prison variables at the county level.

Population demographic data was sourced at the tract level for all U.S. states and then aggregated up to the county-level for calculations. Description of Data Processing: ## All calculations were performed in R. We obtained U.S. Census data from the American Community Survey using the tidycensus package, pulling from Table B03002 (Race and Hispanic Origin) at the Census tract level for all states. We then aggregated tract-level population totals to the county level and merged the county population with the tract data for the measures of residential segregation calculations. We used index formulas from the U.S. Census, Housing Patterns, Appendix B: Measures of Residential Segregation , developed by Massey and Denton (1998) for these calculations. The group segregation measures were calculated as follows: Dissimilarity Index ## The most widelu used measure of evenness is the dissimilarity index, which measures the percentage of the minority group's population that would have to change residence for each neighborhood (in this case, tract) to have the same percentage of that group as the county overall. The index ranges from 0.0 (complete integration) to 1.0 (complete segregation). To calculate the dissimilarity index for each racial/ethnic minority group, first we calculate the tract-specific contribution to the county dissimilarity index, then we sum the tract-specific contributions within counties. The dissimilarity index formula for minority groups and whites is: $$Dissimilarity=.5\u2217\u2211i \u2223(xi/X) \u2212 (wi/W)\u2223$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and W is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the county. Interaction Index ## The interaction index reflect the probabilities that a person in a minority group shares a area with a majority person. To calculate the interaction index for each racial/ethnic minority group, we used the following formula: $$Interaction= \u2211i (xi/X) \u2217 (wi/ti)$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and ti is the total population of the area. Isolation Index ## The isolation index reflects the probabilities that a person in a minority group shares an area with another minority person. To calculate the isolation index for each racial/ethnic minority group, we used the following formula: $$Isolation=\u2211i (xi/X) \u2217 (bi/ti)$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and ti is the total population of the area.

All other areas are classified as Rural. These classifications are done at a census block/tract level and are primarily based on population density and land use.

ZIP_COUNTY ZIP_TRACT COUNTY_ZIP TRACT_ZIP Data Source(s) Description: ## Crosswalk data are sourced from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) United States Postal Service ZIP Code Crosswalk Files . All files downloaded here are for 4th Quarter 2020. Description of Data Source Tables: ## We include 4 types of crosswalk files here. ZIP_COUNTY and ZIP_TRACT are used to allocate ZIP codes to counties or Census tracts. COUNTY_ZIP and TRACT_ZIP are used to allocate counties or Census tracts to ZIP codes. It is important to note that the relationship between the two types of crosswalk files is not a perfectly inverse one. That is to say, you cannot use the ZIP to Tract crosswalk to allocate Census tract data to the ZIP code level. For that you would have to use the Tract to ZIP crosswalk file.
