For each quarter, the goal is to continue to build towards a \u201cfrictionless\u201d solution that accommodates variation in data collection strategies and instruments. For this quarter, we focus on bringing a data validation tool to individual hub staff by (1) validating data submissions and (optionally) (2) using tools to transform data into a format that passes validation. Data harmonization and validation ## Hubs take good care of ensuring data quality and take measures for a high degree of internal validity and a set common core measures exist. However, different hubs may collect, organize, and label data slightly differently due to study design and instrument preference. Therefore, a set of data transformations may be required to conform to the JDC data model. These may include simple transformations such as changing variable names or value labels but may also include a combination of filtering and aggregation transformations for some instruments. Additionally, to satisfy de-identification requirements, local ids must also be mapped to a set of JDC ids. In subsequent sections, we will detail (1) the data model and (2) tools that facilitate replacing local ids with JDC ids, transforming data, and validating these data. Note, the only two mandatory requirements are the use of JDC ids (with or without the use of our tools; we provide a list of JDC ids for mapping) and passing validation (which requires the use of our validation tool). Validated File Submission ## When your data files have passed the validation step (ie conform to the baseline or time point data models), please upload files to your assigned storage location. For a link to this location, contact Mike Kranz ( kranz-michael@norc.org). This validated data will then be uploaded to the JDC for (1) NIDA quarterly reporting and (2) for people granted access, to download data and leverage cloud-based workspaces to perform collaborative analyses by combining individual hub data with a variety of different open-source datasets and other hub datasets (if permissions are granted). Data submission flow ## While some hubs can submit individual level data for staff and/or clients, others can contractually only submit summary data. Below represents a flow chart of the current data workflow. That is, the figure maps the journey from local hub data collection to uploading data on the JDC. For individual data collection, see the instructions on using the MAARC to (optionally) facilitate tranformation and (required) validation tools. flowchart TB subgraph HUBS collect[Collect data via REDCAP,Qualtrics, or other method]; export[Export data in preferred format:\\ncurrently supports XLSX,XLS, SPSS, CSV, and TSV files]; summary[Fill out the template file\\ncontaining subgroup summaries]; map[\"Map to baseline and time point data models:\\n 1.

Install dependencies ## To use the tool, first. Note, if you already have a python, git installation, and virtual environment manager (ie virtualenv or conda), you're ready to go! Note, git is used to store the history of local ids and other If not, here's one way: Install latest version of python here alternatively, one can install conda, preferably the miniconda version, here Install git if using windows, use git for windows . If using a mac, git comes pre-installed. Add git and python to your PATH . if using windows: go to Edit environment variable add the git and python paths (double clicking or pressing Edit... on Path variable) Probable paths if using windows: Git: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Git\\cmd Python: C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python310\\Scripts\\ Setting up tool ## Open a command prompt [this step will be in future hub onboarding] Create a git repository to store id mapping history (if applicable) Create a virtual environment with python utilities installed: If using conda: conda create -n jdc-utils pip Install jdc-utils tool While the location of the package will likely change, currently one can install with this command: pip install git+https://github.com/norc-heal/jdc-utilities.git Usage ## The idea behind this version of the jdc utilities is three-fold. To provide tools to build a stand-alone data package (that includes metadata and data) via the frictionless framework and software suite of tools. To expose a command line interface to make these tools easier to use and easier to understand intermediate steps. For example, to see how the replace id function has replaced ids, to compare the shifted to non shifted dates, and finally to view the transformed dataset that either passed validation (ie conformed to the given data model or did not). To provide tools to automatically go from this stand-alone (but harmonized) data package into the JDC data model for quick exploration of important variables. This workflow provides a scalable way to manage different hub data collection procedures and general enough that many of these elements can be generalized to other use cases. Options for using tools ## There are several options to use these jdc utilities. Use these tools directly in python scripts. Use the command line interface with all the individual parameters. Use the command line interface with configuration files that store the input parameters. Replacing local ids with JDC ids ## C:\\Users\\kranz-michael\\cmder (jdc-utils) \u03bb jdc-utils replace-ids --help Usage: jdc-utils replace-ids [OPTIONS] This function is used to replace (and map) local ids assigned at the time of data collection with separate ids generated by the DASC and given to hubs. Replacing local ids with JDC specific ideas reduces the risk of hub and participant identification. The mapped local to JDC ids are intended to be seen only by hub staff. IN DEVELOPMENT: Additionally, this function accepts remote version control history (ie git repo) to save previous versions. Options: --file-path TEXT Path to a file with locals/old ids to be replaced. Can specify multiple files if need to replace ids across multiple files --id-file TEXT Path to where the generated ids (created by the MAARC and distributed to hubs) exist --map-file TEXT Path to csv where the id mappings are stored -- this will be generated if file does not exist --map-url TEXT Git bare repo set up -- ie the \"remote url\" for sharing mapped ids --column TEXT Name of column across files specified with old (or local) ids. If none specified, defaults to first level (ie 0) pandas dataframe index --config-file TEXT A configuration file containing all required replace-id fields Shifting dates ## (jdc-utils) \u03bb jdc-utils shift-dates --help Usage: jdc-utils shift-dates [OPTIONS] This function takes a specified date field and shifts them around a specified number of days (ie shift amount). This shifted amount is selected randomly within an interval of the previous 182 days and next 182 days. This shift amount is fixed within each individual such that the intervals between dates are retained to provide the capability to calculate derived variables such as days from a given visit/timepoint (e.g., days from baseline or days from release). As with the replace id function, the mappings (i.e., id to the random # of days shifted) is stored in a separate file to reduce deductive disclosure risk from PII linkage with date variables. However, by storing this shift amount (rather than randomly shifting at each data update, the exact dates can be recovered simply by subtracting this added random amount to the shifted date. IN DEVELOPMENT: Additionally, this function accepts remote version control history (ie git repo) to save previous versions. Options: --file-path TEXT Path to a file with dates to be shifted. Can specify multiple files if column name is the same across files --map-file TEXT path to csv where the id mappings are stored -- this will be generated if file does not exist --map-url TEXT Git bare repo set up -- ie the \"remote url\" for sharing mapped ids (optional) --id-column TEXT Name of column across files specified ids. --date-column TEXT Name of date column(s) to be shifted --config-file TEXT A configuration file containing all required shift date Transformation utility for harmonizing datasets to data models ## Transforming data currently leverages functions written with pandas and pandas-flavor decorator. It is a simple two step process: Read in data file to a data frame transforms.read_df(filepath) function from specified data file path Transform data frame to JDC properties and values transforms.run_transformfile(df,transformfile) function from the transform functions specified in a transforms.yaml file (which itself is specified in the config.yaml file) on the dataframe (jdc-utils) \u03bb jdc-utils transform --help Usage: jdc-utils transform [OPTIONS] The transform function runs through a series of transforms (eg renaming ) Options: --transform-file TEXT Path to the given transform file --file-path TEXT Path to the given dataset file --help Show this message and exit. This transformfile contains a way to specify transforms within a simple text file called a \"yaml\" file: Specifies the function, paramater name and parameter input to be run on input data in a yaml file: <name of registered/valid pandas function>: <name of function parameter>: <paramter input (this may be a string, list, or dictionary)> Examples: Example native pandas functions : Rename columns: rename: columns: d4_b: gender record_id: submitter_id is intended to run: df.rename(columns={ 'd4_b':'gender', 'record_id':'submitter_id' }) Validating your harmonized dataset ## The validate command uses frictionless table schema to validate the table and give useful feedback in terms of what needs to be transformed. If it it passes, then the dataset will be saved and ready for submission. (jdc-utils) \u03bb jdc-utils validate --help Usage: jdc-utils validate [OPTIONS] Options: --schema-path TEXT Frictionless table schema JSON or YAML file path --file-path TEXT Path to dataset file(s) --file-type [baseline|time-points] Type of file(s).

Estimate; Per capita income in the past 12 months (in 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars) . Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group. This measure is rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Note: Employment and unemployment estimates may vary from the official labor force data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of differences in survey design and data collection. The following variables were included from DP03 : * Percent estimate; Unemployment Rate . The unemployment rate represents the number of unemployed individuals as a percentage of the civilian labor force. The following variables were included from S1701 : * Percent Estimate; Percent below poverty level . The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.

Description of Data Source Tables: ## Read the complete descriptions of data source tables at HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C Prevalence Estimates : State-level Hepatitis C prevalence estimates (2013-2016 average) from HepVu were published by the Coalition for Applied Modeling for Prevention (CAMP) researchers. These estimates were calculated using four data sources \u2013 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999-2016), National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (1999-2016), American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) (2012-2016), and U.S. Census intercensal data (1999-2016). The Hepatitis C prevalence analyses were restricted to people aged 18 years or older, living within the 50 states and D.C. Rates are expressed as the number of estimated cases per 100,000 people in the population, rounded to the nearest 10 persons. It is an expression of the relative concentration of people with current Hepatitis C infection in an area (state). Estimated cases are rounded to the nearest hundred persons. For a complete description, see HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C State Mortality Data The state-level Hepatitis C mortality data presented on HepVu (single-year data from 2005-2017) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WONDER Online Database System and compiled by researchers at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. The CDC WONDER data are collected using information from death certificates of all U.S. residents within the 50 states and D.C. Deaths of residents of other U.S. territories and fetal deaths are not included. Demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information for each individual is recorded. Any records that included the ICD-10 code for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) or chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as the underlying or multiple cause of death were used to identify deaths related to hepatitis C. For a complete description, see HepVu's Data Methods . Hepatitis C County Mortality Data The county-level hepatitis C mortality data presented on HepVu (single-year data from 2000-2017) were published by Eric Hall, et. al., in a paper titled \u201cCounty-Level Variation in Hepatitis C Virus Mortality and Trends in the United States, 2005-2017.\u201d These estimates were calculated using data from the National Center for Health Statistics Detailed Multiple Cause of Death (1999-2017) using deaths that listed ICD-10 codes for acute viral hepatitis C (B17.1) and chronic viral hepatitis C (B18.2) as a multiple cause of death.

Must-access PDMP starting date MsAcPDMPdt Date of legislation requiring Prescribers to access PDMP before prescribing as interpreted by PDAPS. Electronic PDMP starting date ElcPDMPdt Date state began operating an electronic PDMP system. Data Limitations: ## There currently does not exist a standard definition about what counts as Electronic PDMP. Comments/Notes: ## According to Horowitz et al (2018), the variable AnyPDMPHdt in this dataset records month and year of when any type of PDMP was enacted (including paper-based systems) according to legislation; the variable OpPDMPdt records month and year of when that PDMP data became accessible to any user (e.g., physician, pharmacist, or member of law enforcement) authorized by state law to receive it. Some caveats regarding operational PDMP: States that required prescribers or dispensers to keep records of prescriptions, but not send them to a central repository, were not considered to have a PDMP. If the statute stated a specific date when the PDMP was required to exist, this date was included, not the effective date of the statute. If the authorization of the PDMP was contingent upon receiving sufficient funding, the date of when funding was secured was used. Regarding \u201cmust access\u201d provisions, various data sources use the term \u201cmandatory use\u201d to mean different things. Mandatory use (which differs from mandatory registration) may simply mean that prescribers must have an account on the system; that they must input their patient\u2019s information in the system, or that they must check the system before prescribing an opioid under different circumstances (more on this policy here ). These are ultimately different levels of specificity of the law, and in the spirit of Horowitz et al., 2018, which encourages greater specificity in how these laws are defined, it is appropriate to use the term \u201cphysician must access\u201d only when prescribers are mandated to access the database (regardless of the circumstance, which could differ if it is new patient, existing patient, and so on). The database that best captures this definition is constructed by PDAPS and shows that no state adopted a \u201cprescriber must access\u201d law until 2012. Other papers using data sets showing earlier dates typically have weaker definitions of this policy, such as (a) including state laws that require prescribers to register in the system or use it together \u2013 as was done by Patrick et al., 2016 (Health Affairs paper), or (b) indicating that physicians actually have access to the data in the system, but not requiring that they access the data before prescribing \u2013 which was done in Horowitz et al., 2018 (NBER working paper). Neither of these are a pure \u201cmust access\u201d requirement and could lead to earlier implementation dates than what actually were required for true \u201cmust access\u201d provisions. For example, a lot of papers count Nevada\u2019s 2007 must-access PDMP. PDAPS does not count Nevada because PDAPS only counts policies as must-access if the policy required physicians to access/use the data system based on objective criteria. Nevada\u2019s 2007 law basically said physicians must access \u201cif they suspect abuse\u201d but did not define what \u201csuspected abuse\u201d looked like. In 2015, Nevada put criteria on the conditions requiring PDMP use. As such, the Must Access PDMP captures the need for prescribers to check before prescribing to a patient. Note that this is NOT dispensers to access before dispensing. Also, must-access is interpreted to apply to ANY subset of patients.","title":"PDMP 2017"},{"location":"oeps/PDMP_2017/#data-location","text":"PS03 - at the state level.

Some caveats regarding operational PDMP: States that required prescribers or dispensers to keep records of prescriptions, but not send them to a central repository, were not considered to have a PDMP. If the statute stated a specific date when the PDMP was required to exist, this date was included, not the effective date of the statute. If the authorization of the PDMP was contingent upon receiving sufficient funding, the date of when funding was secured was used. Regarding \u201cmust access\u201d provisions, various data sources use the term \u201cmandatory use\u201d to mean different things. Mandatory use (which differs from mandatory registration) may simply mean that prescribers must have an account on the system; that they must input their patient\u2019s information in the system, or that they must check the system before prescribing an opioid under different circumstances (more on this policy here ). These are ultimately different levels of specificity of the law, and in the spirit of Horowitz et al., 2018, which encourages greater specificity in how these laws are defined, it is appropriate to use the term \u201cphysician must access\u201d only when prescribers are mandated to access the database (regardless of the circumstance, which could differ if it is new patient, existing patient, and so on). The database that best captures this definition is constructed by PDAPS and shows that no state adopted a \u201cprescriber must access\u201d law until 2012. Other papers using data sets showing earlier dates typically have weaker definitions of this policy, such as (a) including state laws that require prescribers to register in the system or use it together \u2013 as was done by Patrick et al., 2016 (Health Affairs paper), or (b) indicating that physicians actually have access to the data in the system, but not requiring that they access the data before prescribing \u2013 which was done in Horowitz et al., 2018 (NBER working paper). Neither of these are a pure \u201cmust access\u201d requirement and could lead to earlier implementation dates than what actually were required for true \u201cmust access\u201d provisions. For example, a lot of papers count Nevada\u2019s 2007 must-access PDMP. PDAPS does not count Nevada because PDAPS only counts policies as must-access if the policy required physicians to access/use the data system based on objective criteria. Nevada\u2019s 2007 law basically said physicians must access \u201cif they suspect abuse\u201d but did not define what \u201csuspected abuse\u201d looked like. In 2015, Nevada put criteria on the conditions requiring PDMP use. As such, the Must Access PDMP captures the need for prescribers to check before prescribing to a patient. Note that this is NOT dispensers to access before dispensing. Also, must-access is interpreted to apply to ANY subset of patients.","title":"Comments/Notes:"},{"location":"oeps/Prison%20variables_2016/","text":"Meta Data Name : Prison Incarceration Rates Last Modified : August 26th, 2020 Author : Qinyun Lin Data Location: ## PS01 - Prison variables at the county level.

File can be found here . * BE05_C Data Source(s) Description: ## All data was sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018 5-year estimates. Population demographic data was sourced at the tract level for all U.S. states and then aggregated up to the county-level for calculations. Description of Data Processing: ## All calculations were performed in R. We obtained U.S. Census data from the American Community Survey using the tidycensus package, pulling from Table B03002 (Race and Hispanic Origin) at the Census tract level for all states. We then aggregated tract-level population totals to the county level and merged the county population with the tract data for the measures of residential segregation calculations. We used index formulas from the U.S. Census, Housing Patterns, Appendix B: Measures of Residential Segregation , developed by Massey and Denton (1998) for these calculations. The group segregation measures were calculated as follows: Dissimilarity Index ## The most widelu used measure of evenness is the dissimilarity index, which measures the percentage of the minority group's population that would have to change residence for each neighborhood (in this case, tract) to have the same percentage of that group as the county overall. The index ranges from 0.0 (complete integration) to 1.0 (complete segregation). To calculate the dissimilarity index for each racial/ethnic minority group, first we calculate the tract-specific contribution to the county dissimilarity index, then we sum the tract-specific contributions within counties. The dissimilarity index formula for minority groups and whites is: $$Dissimilarity=.5\u2217\u2211i \u2223(xi/X) \u2212 (wi/W)\u2223$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and W is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the county. Interaction Index ## The interaction index reflect the probabilities that a person in a minority group shares a area with a majority person. To calculate the interaction index for each racial/ethnic minority group, we used the following formula: $$Interaction= \u2211i (xi/X) \u2217 (wi/ti)$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and ti is the total population of the area. Isolation Index ## The isolation index reflects the probabilities that a person in a minority group shares an area with another minority person. To calculate the isolation index for each racial/ethnic minority group, we used the following formula: $$Isolation=\u2211i (xi/X) \u2217 (bi/ti)$$ where xi is the number of minority group residents (Black, Hispanic, Asian) in each tract, X is the number of minority group residents in the county, wi is the number of non-Hispanic white residents in the tract, and ti is the total population of the area.

Three additional categories of residential segregation measurements described by Massey and Denton (1998) include measures of concentration, centralization, and clustering. Read more on the indices and their expressions from the U.S. Census Bureau . Comments/Notes: ## From the U.S. Census Bureau , on Measures of Residential Segregation: \"Massey and Denton (1988) used an extensive literature search and cluster analysis to identify 20 different indexes of segregation and classify them into five key dimensions of segregation. Basically, evenness involves the differential distribution of the subject population, exposure measures potential contact, concentration refers to the relative amount of physical space occupied, centralization indicates the degree to which a group is located near the center of an urban area, and clustering measures the degree to which minority group members live disproportionately in contiguous areas.\"\" Note: In all of the calculations, non-Hispanic whites are considered the \"majority\" (reference) population.","title":"Residential Seg Indices"},{"location":"oeps/Residential_Seg_Indices/#data-location","text":"BE05 - Residential Segregation Indicies calculated at the county level.
