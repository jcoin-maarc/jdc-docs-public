# Justice Community Opioid Intervention Network (JCOIN) Data Commons Documentation

## About JCOIN

Many people with opioid use disorder (OUD) pass through the criminal justice system. Improved access to high-quality, evidence-based addiction treatment in justice settings will be critical to addressing the opioid crisis.

As part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, JCOIN studies approaches to increase high-quality care for people with opioid misuse and OUD in justice settings. JCOIN will test strategies to expand effective treatment and care in partnership with local and state justice systems and community-based treatment providers.
