# Exploration Page

The exploration page enables the user to explore the data common's harmonized data as well as files through dynamic filters and marginal distribution charts. 

Note, the exploration page only shows data and files the user has been granted access.

## Data Tabs

Data tabs represent a way to select a participant cohort and view marginal distributions of this cohort. The "data" represents the harmonized records (ie observations) mapped to the data (graph) model.  

There are two data tabs: 

### Participants (staff and clients) Tab

Contains data on the person level (1 observation=1 person) with marginal distributions for key variables that are a part of the quarterly report.


### Time points (clients only) Tab

Contains data on the time point level (1 observation=1 time point) with a marginal distribution of visit type.

## File Tabs

File tabs represent a way to search and download files based on information (metadata) about these files.

### Files Tab

This tab contains a way to search and download files a user has access to. A user can search by type of file or by study. For example, say a user wants to access an SPSS file for a particular project. The user would click on the project and "SAV" data type. Then, the user can either download the file directly by clicking on the desired GUID link in the bottom table or export a group of files to the workspace.
 
### OEPS

This contains files from the OEPS data warehouse. It is searchable by dimensions as defined by the OEPS team (e.g., "construct," "spatial dimension," and "variable")


The video below demonstrates the functionality of the two data types (called "Data" and "File").
