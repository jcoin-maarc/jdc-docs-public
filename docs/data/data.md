# Data in the JDC

## Hub Core Measures

Standardizing (ie harmonizing) a series of core domains via survey questions collected across hubs to support standardized reporting and
data sharing.  PII removal and additional de-identification steps (i.e., using JDC specific 
individual identifiers and randomly shifting dates) are performed and then the data structure, variable names, and values are transformed into unified data models representing these core measures in addition to other variable necessary for cross-hub reporting.

## Amerispeak Surveys: Opioid Use Disorder Stigma

Tracking changes in stigma associated with OUD is important, for as stigma intensifies over time it might make it more difficult to find positive treatment effects in JCOIN. Given the critical importance of public opinion towards policy making and approaches used in the justice system, this project will measure public support for OUD treatment in the general public, assess stigma associated with OUD, and perceptions of criminality around OUD.
