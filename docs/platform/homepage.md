Upon coming to the data commons, users are directed to the home page (ie landing) page. This page serves to provide (a) quick access to key features and (b) an understanding of data and files currently in the JDC.

## Total Count Charts

- **Total participants:** The total number of unique participants. Studies submitting individual level and aggregated count data make up this metric. 
- **Total time points:** The total number of time points mapped to the data model where a participant may have multiple time points (e.g., one participant completing one baseline and one follow up has 2 time points). This count only includes studies submitting individual level data to the JDC. 
- **Files:** The total number of files a user can download, load into the workspace, or view metadata.
