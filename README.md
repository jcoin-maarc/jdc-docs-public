# JDC Documentation

This repository makes the documentation for the 
JCOIN data commons using mkdocs and related plugins.

Install python (tested with 3.9) ideally in a virtual environment

## Set up

```python

# To install mkdocs and the 
# mermaid plugin for diagram creation:
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin

# install packages from documetnation creation
pip install pandas #or conda install pandas if using conda

# jsonpath expressions for simplifying work with frictionless schema
pip install jsonpath_ng

# install pdf creation plugin
There are a few packages available such as mkdocs-with-pdf
On Windows, both give the error:
```
```cannot load library 'gobject-2.0-0': error 0x7e.  Additionally, ctypes.util.find_library() did not manage to locate a library called 'gobject-2.0-0'```

```

## Notes

Now using frictionless so submission procedures will center around using this.
