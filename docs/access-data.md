# Access Data

Principal investigators (PIs) and their research teams may access all of the data submitted by their hub to the JDC. PIs may also authorize collaborators to access their hub's data. Participants in joint projects will be granted access to combined data products on a per-project basis.

Please complete the following instructions to access a hub's data products and workspaces on the JDC:

1. **Determine your login method for the JDC**. Navigate to [https://jcoin.datacommons.io/login](https://jcoin.datacommons.io/login) and log in via one of the available options. The JDC currently supports authentication via Google (using a gmail or Google-enabled institutional email address) and ORCID. 
2. **Request access by emailing [jcoin-support@gen3.org](mailto:jcoin-support@gen3.org)** the following information, copying the Principal Investigator of the hub whose data you're requesting:
    1. Name of the hub whose data you're requesting authorization to access
    2. Email address or ORCID iD you will use to log in to the JDC _(your data access is granted under a specific username; please ensure you are able to successfully log in before requesting authorization to access data)_

The Principal Investigator must be copied on and approve your access request before authorization can be granted. The PI can simply reply to the email with "I approve," or they can request access on your behalf by supplying the above information.
