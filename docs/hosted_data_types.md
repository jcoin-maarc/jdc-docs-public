# Types of data and metadata in the JDC

<!-- Make workflow of data dictionary to files etc -->


There are two types of data within the JDC: structured data and files. 

- Structured data contain records conforming to a common data model.
    - Foundation to data harmonization and cross-study analyses.
    - These records may contain what researchers typically classify as "data" or "metadata."
        - "Data" is defined as a study's collected observations. 
        - "Metadata" is data that describes other data.
        - The "data" may be demographics, survey questionnaire answers, or biomeasure quantities at specific individuals.
        - The "metadata" may be records that describe this data like study or protocol information. However, it can also be information that describes files. These files may be within the individual. For example, an imaging study may collect imaging files. These imaging files have "metadata" associated with them such as the scanning procedure that is consistent across the study's imaging files. However, it also may contain metadata that identifies the participant, study, etc in addition to its unique "digital footprint" information, important to detect file changes.
