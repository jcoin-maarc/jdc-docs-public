Our tools support a workflow ranging from novel de-identification tools, data transformations, and data validation. Data harmonization and validation ## Hubs take good care of ensuring data quality and take measures for a high degree of internal validity and a set common core measures exist. However, different hubs may collect, organize, and label data slightly differently due to study design and instrument preference. Therefore, a set of data transformations may be required to conform to the JDC data model. These may include simple transformations such as changing variable names or value labels but may also include a combination of filtering and aggregation transformations for some instruments. Additionally, to satisfy de-identification requirements, local ids must also be mapped to a set of JDC ids. In subsequent sections, we will detail (1) the data model and (2) tools that facilitate replacing local ids with JDC ids, transforming data, and validating these data. Note, the only two mandatory requirements are the use of JDC ids (with or without the use of our tools; we provide a list of JDC ids for mapping) and passing validation (which requires the use of our validation tool). Validated File Submission ## When your data files have passed the validation step (ie conform to the baseline or time point data models), please upload files to your assigned storage location. For a link to this location, contact Mike Kranz ( kranz-michael@norc.org). This validated data will then be uploaded to the JDC for (1) NIDA quarterly reporting and (2) for people granted access, to download data and leverage cloud-based workspaces to perform collaborative analyses by combining individual hub data with a variety of different open-source datasets and other hub datasets (if permissions are granted).
